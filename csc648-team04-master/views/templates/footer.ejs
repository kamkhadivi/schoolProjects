					PARSE (Pollution and Accident Reporting for a Safer Environment) is the environmental reporting tool that will make your city a cleaner and safer place for everyone.
					With our website, you can report environmental issues such as poorly disposed trash and chemical waste. Upon approval, the problem will then be viewable by the necessary entities so that the issue may be resolved. You may also use our website to view existing environmental issues at locations where they were reported.<br><br>

					Project built by PARSE, Team 4 of Dr. Dragutin Petkovic's CSC 648/848 section 01 class at <a href="http://www.sfsu.edu/" target="_blank">San Francisco State University</a>.
